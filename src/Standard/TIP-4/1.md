# Non-Fungible Token Metadata (TIP-4.1)

## Abstract

Metadata is a set of pre-defined fields that are used to properly display NFTs' information on front-end.

## Motivation

Wallets and marketplaces should support the display of metadata associated with tokens, in accordance with the standards described here. Wallets and marketplaces should pull the on-chain data JSON and use them to display all relevant data.

Follow the standards defined in this document to ensure your NFTs will be correctly displayed in most wallets and marketplaces and to allow usage of all functionalities related to NFTs.

Explorers, Wallets and Marketplaces should ensure they have these checks in place before choosing to display the token as an NFT.

| `name` | Human readable name of the asset |
| `symbol` | Human readable symbol of the asset (if any) |
| `description` | Human readable description of the asset |
| `image` | URL to the image of the asset. PNG, GIF and JPG file formats are supported. You may use the ?ext={file_extension} query to provide information on the file type |

| `external_url` | URL to an external application or website where users can also view the asset |
