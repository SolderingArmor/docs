# Non-Fungible Token - Basic Token (TIP-4.2)

## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for non-fungible tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer and manage tokens.

## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Everscale blockchain to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.
This standard:
 * Respects asynchronous nature of Everscale blockchain (includes callbacks and callback getters);
 * Covers only the `Token` without auction or complex logic built in (UNIX way);
 * Follows `one Token = one Contract` paradigm;
 * Follows KISS paradigm;
 * Can have only internal owners (addresses);
 * Doesn't require the owner to worry about `Token` balances (gas management);
 * Keeps all the structure in JSON format, this allows to have different data standards without the need to change token code;

## Entities

### BasicToken

`BasicToken` - Contract that represents a single non-fungible `Token`. Following distributed programming paradigm, one `Token` is one contract. `Token` stores general information and metadata in JSON format. Metadata is always stored on-chain.

### BasicCollection

`BasicCollection` - Contract that represents `Collection` that can mint `Tokens`. 

## Specification

## Token

### Callbacks

#### onSetAuthorityCallback

When `Authority` of the `Token` is changed this callback is called with new `Authority` address as a receiver. This callback can start a chain of events needed after `Authority` has been changed.

Every entity that wants to act as `Authority` needs to implement this interface, otherwise transaction will bounce and `Authority` will be reset.

``` solidity
interface IBasicTokenSetAuthorityCallback
{
        function onSetAuthorityCallback(
            address collectionAddress,
            uint256 tokenID,
            address ownerAddress,
            TvmCell payload) external;
}
```

### Methods

#### getBasicInfo

Returns `Token` information.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `includeMetadata` | If metadata should be included |

Return values:

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `collectionAddress` | Token collection address |
| `tokenID`           | Token ID |
| `ownerAddress`      | Token `Owner` |
| `authorityAddress`  | Token `Authority`; when set it can change the Owner and itself, used as a temporary manager for auctions, staking, farming, etc. |
| `metadata`          | Token metadata in JSON format |

``` solidity
function getBasicInfo(bool includeMetadata) external view responsible returns (
    address        collectionAddress,
    uint256        tokenID,
    address        ownerAddress,
    address        authorityAddress,
    string         metadata);
```

#### setOwner

Changes Token `Owner`. Current `Owner` can change the `Owner` only if `_authorityAddress` is zero, otherwise only `Authority` can change `Owner`.

Resets `Authority` after successfull change.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `ownerAddress` | New `Owner` address |

``` solidity
function setOwner(address ownerAddress) external;
```

#### setAuthority

Changes Token `Authority`. Current `Owner` can change the `Authority` only if `_authorityAddress` is zero, otherwise only `Authority` can change `Authority`.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `authorityAddress` | New `Authority` address |
| `payload`          | Custom payload for custom `Authority` logic |

``` solidity
function setAuthority(address authorityAddress, TvmCell payload) external;
```

#### destroy

Destroys Token.

WARNING! This can not be undone!

``` solidity
function destroy() external;
```

### Events

#### ownerChanged

Emitted when Token `Owner` is changed.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `from` | Old `Owner` address |
| `to`   | New `Owner` address |

``` solidity
event ownerChanged(address from, address to);
```

#### authorityChanged

Emitted when Token `Authority` is changed.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `from` | Old `Authority` address |
| `to`   | New `Authority` address |

``` solidity
event authorityChanged(address from, address to);
```

#### destroyed

Emitted when Token owner is changed.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `ownerAddress` | Owner address who performed destroy operation |

``` solidity
event destroyed(address ownerAddress);
```

## Collection
### Methods

#### getBasicInfo

Returns collection information

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `includeMetadata`  | If metadata should be included |
| `includeTokenCode` | If token code should be included |

Return values:

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `nonce`        | Random nonce to have random collection address |
| `tokenCode`    | TvmCell of the token code |
| `tokensIssued` | Number of tokens this collection created |
| `ownerAddress` | Owner address |
| `metadata`     | Collection metadata; it has the same format as Token metadata but keeps collection cover and information |

``` solidity
function getBasicInfo(bool includeMetadata, bool includeTokenCode) external view responsible returns(
    uint256        nonce,
    TvmCell        tokenCode,
    uint256        tokensIssued,
    address        ownerAddress,
    string         metadata);
```

#### setOwner

Changes Collection `Owner`.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `ownerAddress` | New `Owner` address |

``` solidity
function setOwner(address ownerAddress) external;
```

### Events

#### ownerChanged

Emitted when Collection `Owner` is changed.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `from` | Old owner address |
| `to`   | New owner address |

``` solidity
event ownerChanged(address from, address to);
```

#### mint

Minted new Token.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `tokenID`          | ID of the new Token |
| `tokenAddress`     | Address of a new Token |
| `ownerAddress`     | Address of a new Token `Owner` |
| `initiatorAddress` | Address of who initiated mint operation |

``` solidity
event mint(uint256 tokenID, address tokenAddress, address ownerAddress, address initiatorAddress);
```

## Reference implementation

Reference implemantation includes:

- `Basic Collection` (`contracts/BasicCollection.sol`)
- `Basic Token` (`contracts/BasicToken.sol`)

## Gas usage

- `Collection` deployment: 0.08 EVER (0.01 EVER is stored on `Collection` address to keep address/account not frozen);
- Single `Token` creation: 0.11 EVER (0.01 EVER is stored on `Token` address to keep address/account not frozen);

Both `Collection` and `Token` gas usages grow linearly. It means in order to create 1000 `Tokens` you will need 0/11 * 1000 gas.
