# Non-Fungible Token - Liquid NFT (TIP-4.2)

## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for non-fungible tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer and manage tokens.

## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Everscale blockchain to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.
This standard:
 * Respects asynchronous nature of Everscale blockchain (includes callbacks and callback getters);
 * Covers only the `Token` without auction or complex logic built in (UNIX way);
 * Follows `one Token = one Contract` paradigm;
 * Follows KISS paradigm;
 * Can have only internal owners (addresses);
 * Doesn't require the owner to worry about `Token` balances (gas management);
 * Keeps all the structure in JSON format, this allows to have different data standards without the need to change token code;

## Entities

### LiquidNFT

`LiquidNFT` - Contract that represents a single non-fungible `Token`. Following distributed programming paradigm, one `Token` is one contract. `Token` stores general information and metadata in JSON format. Metadata is always stored on-chain.

`Token` can be of two different types: `Master Edition + Print` and `Normal NFT`.

#### Master Edition

A `Master Edition` token, when minted, represents both a non-fungible token on Everscale and metadata that allows creators to control the provenance of prints created from the `Master Edition`.

Rights to create prints are tokenized itself, and the owner of the `Collection` can distribute tokens that allow users to create prints from `Master Editions`. Additionally, the creator can set the max supply of the `Master Edition` just like a regular mint on Everscale, with the main difference being that each print is a numbered edition created from it.

A notable and desirable effect of `Master Editions` is that as prints are sold, the artwork will still remain visible in the artist's wallet as a `Master Edition`, while the prints appear in the purchaser's wallets.

#### Print

A `Print` represents a copy of an NFT, and is created from a `Master Edition`. Each `Print` has an edition number associated with it (`Token ID` stays the same within all `Prints` of one `Master Edition`).

#### Normal NFT

A `Normal NFT` when minted represents a non-fungible token on Everscale and metadata, but lacks rights to print. An example of a `Normal NFT` would be an artwork that is a one-of-a-kind that, once sold, is no longer within the artist's own wallet, but is in the purchaser's wallet.

### LiquidNFTSingle

`LiquidNFTSingle` represents a single standalone NFT without the need to create a `Collection`.

### LiquidNFTCollection

`LiquidNFTCollection` - Contract that represents `Collection` that can mint `Tokens`.

``` solidity
struct CreatorShare

function getInfo(bool includeMetadata) external view returns (
    address        collectionAddress,
    uint256        tokenID,
    address        ownerAddress,
    address        creatorAddress,
    bool           primarySaleHappened,
    string         metadataContents,
    bool           metadataIsMutable,
    address        metadataAuthorityAddress,
    uint256        masterEditionSupply,
    uint256        masterEditionMaxSupply,
    bool           masterEditionPrintLocked,
    uint256        editionNumber,
    uint16         creatorsPercent,
    CreatorShare[] creatorsShares);

function callInfo(bool includeMetadata) external responsible view returns (
    address        collectionAddress,
    uint256        tokenID,
    address        ownerAddress,
    address        creatorAddress,
    bool           primarySaleHappened,
    string         metadataContents,
    bool           metadataIsMutable,
    address        metadataAuthorityAddress,
    uint256        masterEditionSupply,
    uint256        masterEditionMaxSupply,
    bool           masterEditionPrintLocked,
    uint256        editionNumber,
    uint16         creatorsPercent,
    CreatorShare[] creatorsShares);
```

#### changeOwner

Changes NFT owner.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `ownerAddress` | New owner address |

``` solidity
function changeOwner(address ownerAddress) external;
```

#### changeOwnerWithPrimarySale

Changes NFT owner and flips `primarySaleHappened` flag to `true`.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `ownerAddress` | New owner address |

``` solidity
function changeOwnerWithPrimarySale(address ownerAddress) external;
```

#### updateMetadata

Changes NFT metadata if `metadataIsMutable` is `true`.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|

``` solidity
function updateMetadata(string metadataContents) external;
```

#### lockMetadata

Locks NFT metadata.

``` solidity
function lockMetadata() external;
```

#### printCopy

Prints a copy of the NFT.
Sometimes when you need multiple copies of the same NFT you can.. well..
create multiple copies of the same NFT (like coins or medals etc.) 
and they will technically different NFTs but at the same time logically 
they will be the same. Printing allows you to have multiple copies of the 
same NFT (with the same `tokenID`) distributed to any number of people. Every
one of them will be able to sell or transfer their own copy.

|-----------|-------------|
| `targetOwnerAddress` | Address who receives a print |

``` solidity
function printCopy(address targetOwnerAddress) external;
```

function lockPrint() external;

WARNING! This can not be undone!

``` solidity
function destroy() external;
```

## Reference implementation

Reference implemantation includes:

- `Collection` (`contracts/LiquidNFTCollection.sol`)
- `Token` (`contracts/LiquidNFT.sol`)
- Standalone `Token`, without a `Collection` (`contracts/LiquidNFTSingle.sol`)

Link: https://github.com/SolderingArmor/liquid-nft

## Gas usage

- `Collection` deployment: 0.08 EVER (0.01 EVER is stored on `Collection` address to keep address/account not frozen);
- Single `Token` creation: 0.11 EVER (0.01 EVER is stored on `Token` address to keep address/account not frozen);
