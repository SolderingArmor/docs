# Non-Fungible Token - Liquid Token (TIP-4.3)

## Abstract

The following standard extends `TIP-4.2` Basic Token to support `Classic NFTs` including art and generative collections.

Standard interface functions from `TIP-4.2` standard are not covered here (to avoid information duplication) but are a must for implementation.

## Entities

### LiquidToken

`LiquidToken` - Contract that represents a single non-fungible `Token`. Following distributed programming paradigm, one `Token` is one contract. `Token` stores general information and metadata in JSON format. Metadata is always stored on-chain.

`Token` can be of two different types: `Master Edition + Print` and `Normal Token`.

#### Master Edition

A `Master Edition` token, when minted, represents both a non-fungible token on Everscale and metadata that allows creators to control the provenance of prints created from the `Master Edition`.

Rights to create prints are tokenized itself, and the owner of the `Collection` can distribute tokens that allow users to create prints from `Master Editions`. Additionally, the creator can set the max supply of the `Master Edition` just like a regular mint on Everscale, with the main difference being that each print is a numbered edition created from it.

A notable and desirable effect of `Master Editions` is that as prints are sold, the artwork will still remain visible in the artist's wallet as a `Master Edition`, while the prints appear in the purchaser's wallets.

#### Print

A `Print` represents a copy of an Token, and is created from a `Master Edition`. Each `Print` has an edition number associated with it (`Token ID` stays the same within all `Prints` of one `Master Edition`).

#### Normal Token

A `Normal Token` when minted represents a non-fungible token on Everscale and metadata, but lacks rights to print. An example of a `Normal Token` would be an artwork that is a one-of-a-kind that, once sold, is no longer within the artist's own wallet, but is in the purchaser's wallet.

### LiquidTokenSingle

`LiquidTokenSingle` represents a single standalone Token without the need to create a `Collection`.

### LiquidCollection

`LiquidCollection` - Contract that represents `Collection` that can mint `Tokens`. 

## Specification

## Token
### Methods

#### getInfo

Returns `Token` information.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|

| `metadata`                 | Token metadata in JSON format |
| `primarySaleHappened`      | If 100% of the first sale should be distributed between the creators list |
| `metadataLocked`           | Boolean if metadata is mutable and can be changed |
| `metadataAuthorityAddress` | Address of an authority who can update metadata (if it is mutable) |
| `printSupply`              | Current amount of copies if the token can be printed |

| `printLocked`              | If print is available or locked |
| `printID`                  | Master edition (original token) always has `editionNumber` = 0, printed versions have 1+ |
| `creatorsPercent`          | Defines how many percent creators get when NFT is sold on a secondary market |
| `creatorsShares`           | Defines a list of creators with their shares |

``` solidity
struct CreatorShare
{
    address creatorAddress; // 
    uint16  creatorShare;   // 100 = 1% share
}

function getInfo(bool includeMetadata) external view responsible returns (
    address        collectionAddress,
    uint256        tokenID,
    address        ownerAddress,
    address        authorityAddress,
    string         metadata,
    bool           primarySaleHappened,
    bool           metadataLocked,
    address        metadataAuthorityAddress,
    uint256        printSupply,
    uint256        printMaxSupply,
    bool           printLocked,
    uint256        printID,
    uint16         creatorsPercent,
    CreatorShare[] creatorsShares);
```

#### setMetadata

Changes NFT metadata if `metadataLocked` is `true`.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `metadata` | New metadata in JSON format |

``` solidity
function setMetadata(string metadata) external;
```

#### lockMetadata

Locks NFT metadata.

``` solidity
function lockMetadata() external;
```

#### printCopy

Prints a copy of the NFT.
Sometimes when you need multiple copies of the same NFT you can.. well..
create multiple copies of the same NFT (like coins or medals etc.) 
and they will technically different NFTs but at the same time logically 
they will be the same. Printing allows you to have multiple copies of the 
same NFT (with the same `tokenID`) distributed to any number of people. Every
one of them will be able to sell or transfer their own copy.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `targetOwnerAddress` | Address who receives a print |

``` solidity
function printCopy(address targetOwnerAddress) external;
```

#### lockPrint

Locks NFT printing.

``` solidity
function lockPrint() external;
```

#### destroy

Destroys NFT.
WARNING! This can not be undone!

``` solidity
function destroy() external;
```

### Events

#### metadataChanged

Emitted when NFT metadata is changed.

``` solidity
event metadataChanged();
```

#### printCreated

Emitted when NFT copy is printed.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `printID`      | ID of the print |
| `printAddress` | Address of the print |

``` solidity
event printCreated(uint256 printID, address printAddress);
```

## Reference implementation

Reference implemantation includes:

- `Generative Collection` (`contracts/LiquidCollection.sol`)
- `Generative Token` (`contracts/LiquidToken.sol`)
- Standalone `Generative Token`, without a `Collection` (`contracts/LiquidTokenSingle.sol`)

Link: https://github.com/SolderingArmor/liquid-nft

## Gas usage

- `Collection` deployment: 0.08 EVER (0.01 EVER is stored on `Collection` address to keep address/account not frozen);
- Single `Token` creation: 0.11 EVER (0.01 EVER is stored on `Token` address to keep address/account not frozen);

Both `Collection` and `Token` gas usages grow linearly. It means in order to create 1000 `Tokens` you will need 0/11 * 1000 gas.
